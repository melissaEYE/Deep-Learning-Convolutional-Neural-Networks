# Deep-Learning-Convolutional-Neural-Networks

The purpose of the analysis was to accurately identify objects in the images, such as a truck or car. To accomplish this purpose, a method of deep learning referred to as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), was employed. 

 The dataset for the analysis was CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky, 2009). https://github.com/melissaEYE/Deep-Learning-Convolutional-Neural-Networks/blob/main/CNN.xlsx
 
 Inspired by nature and the human brain, deep learning models are designed to extract key features from an image to identify its contents (Panyam, 2017; Knode, 2022).  There are several types of deep learning models, however, this analysis will use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) which are a form of neural network most often used for image processing (LeCun, Yann, et al., 1998). 
 
 The full report can be found in the file "Deep Learning CNN.pdf". This report shows a complete breakdown of my analysis, including problem identification, motivation, data exploration, data preparation, data partition, modeling, model results, model tuning, and proposed solutions. Tables and visualizations are also included.

The Python script is included in the file "12_CIFAR-10.ipynd" for model 12 and "8_CIFAR-10.ipynd" for model 8. Instructions on how to use the program are included as comments in the file. After opening the file, please read the instructions carefully before executing the code to ensure that the program functions correctly.
